# Business website
This is a responsive business website created as part of my personal development and skill improvement journey. The main goal of this project was to practice modern web design techniques, including responsive layouts for various screen sizes and clean, user-friendly UI design.

The website structure is built with HTML, styled using CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript to provide an engaging and interactive experience. The design focuses on simplicity, clarity, and adaptability across devices, ensuring optimal usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

This project is not intended for commercial use but as a way to strengthen my front-end development skills and experiment with responsive design best practices.
